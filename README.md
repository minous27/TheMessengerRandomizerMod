## The beginning of rando for The Messenger! - Minous27

**This is the Work-in-Progress project for The Messenger Randomizer. Initial version of the mod currently in development.**

---
### Installation Instructions
---

Early builds of the randomizer mod will be fairly involved in their installation procedures. These will be improved with development of the mod.

#### Install Courier 

The Messenger Randomizer relies on the Courier Mod Loader to be properly loaded and handled by the game. If you have not already installed Courier, please follow the instructions to install it first then come back here to continue with the randomizer installation. Don't worry, I'll wait. :D

**_PLEASE NOTE THAT THE RANDOMIZER MAY ONLY WORK WITH CERTAIN VERSIONS OF COURIER DURING THE COURSE OF BOTH APPLICATIONS' DEVELOPMENTS. VERSION 0.4 WAS BUILT WITH 'v0.7.0-alpha' BUT MAKE SURE YOU CONFIRM THE COURIER VERSION FOR THE RANDOMIZER VERSION YOU ARE INSTALLING(SHOULD BE IN THE RELEASE NOTES)_**

#### Install Randomizer Mod

With Courier installed, it is time to install the randomizer mod. To install the mod:

1. Download the preferred version of the mod from the [Releases](https://github.com/minous27/TheMessengerRandomizerMod/releases) page.
    * You will need the zip file. Do not bother unzipping it, just download it. 
2. Once the file is downloaded, place the zip file directly into the _Mods_ directory for the game that the Courier installer created.
    * This location will vary based on where you have your game installed on your machine. For example, my destination was _'drive_name:\Steam\steamapps\common\The Messenger\Mods'_.

And the mod is now properly installed and ready to be loaded when you open up the game.
